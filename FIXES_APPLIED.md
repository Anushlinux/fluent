## What You Need to Do Now

### Option 1: Full Setup (Recommended)

Follow these steps to get everything working:

1. **Create Supabase Project**
   - Go to https://supabase.com
   - Create a new project (free tier is fine)
   - Wait ~2 minutes for project creation

2. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Go to Project Settings â†’ API
   - Copy your Project URL
   - Copy your anon/public key

3. **Update Environment File**
   - Edit `website/.env.local`
   - Replace the placeholder values:
     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project.supabase.co
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...your-actual-key
     ```

4. **Create Database Tables**
   - Open Supabase SQL Editor
   - Copy SQL from `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
   - Run all three sections:
     - Create Tables
     - Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
     - Trigger for Profile Creation

5. **Restart Dev Server**
   ```bash
   cd website
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Test It**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001
   - You should see the welcome screen (not the setup screen)
   - Click "Sign Up" to create an account
   - Try "Load Demo Data" or upload a JSON file

### Option 2: Quick Test (No Database)

If you just want to see the UI improvements without full setup:

1. Restart the dev server
2. You'll see the new setup screen with instructions
3. The error messages are now helpful instead of empty `{}`
