    <h2>Understanding Blockchain Technology</h2>
    <p>
        A <span class="highlight">blockchain</span> is a revolutionary technology that serves as the foundation 
        for cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. Unlike traditional databases, a blockchain is 
        distributed across multiple computers, making it extremely secure and transparent.
    </p>

    <h2>Smart Contracts and DeFi</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">Smart contracts</span> are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain. 
        They enable <span class="highlight">DeFi</span> (Decentralized Finance) applications, allowing users to 
        lend, borrow, and trade without intermediaries like banks. Popular DeFi platforms use 
        <span class="highlight">Solidity</span> for development.
    </p>

    <h2>NFTs and Digital Ownership</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">NFTs</span> (Non-Fungible Tokens) represent unique digital assets on the blockchain. 
        Unlike fungible <span class="highlight">tokens</span> where each unit is identical, every NFT is distinct. 
        You'll need a crypto <span class="highlight">wallet</span> like <span class="highlight">MetaMask</span> 
        to buy, sell, or trade NFTs.
    </p>

    <h2>Earning and Staking</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">Staking</span> allows cryptocurrency holders to earn rewards by locking up their 
        assets to support network operations. This is different from <span class="highlight">mining</span>, which 
        requires computational power to validate transactions. Many users also participate in 
        <span class="highlight">yield farming</span> by providing liquidity to <span class="highlight">liquidity pools</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>Consensus and Validation</h2>
    <p>
        Blockchain networks use various <span class="highlight">consensus</span> mechanisms to validate transactions. 
        While Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (mining), Ethereum now uses Proof of Stake (staking). These mechanisms 
        ensure all participants agree on the blockchain's state without a central authority.
    </p>

    <h2>Building dApps</h2>
    <p>
        Developers build <span class="highlight">dApps</span> (decentralized applications) that run on blockchain 
        networks instead of centralized servers. These applications often follow standards like 
        <span class="highlight">ERC-20</span> for fungible tokens. <span class="highlight">Oracles</span> help 
        dApps access real-world data by acting as bridges between the blockchain and external information sources.
    </p>

    <h2>Scaling Solutions</h2>
    <p>
        As blockchain networks grow, <span class="highlight">gas fees</span> can become expensive during high traffic. 
        <span class="highlight">Layer 2</span> solutions help by processing transactions off the main chain, 
        reducing costs and improving speed while maintaining security.
    </p>

    <h2>Community Governance</h2>
    <p>
        A <span class="highlight">DAO</span> (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a community-led entity 
        with no central authority. Token holders vote on proposals, making DAOs a revolutionary form of 
        organizational structure in the <span class="highlight">Web3</span> ecosystem.
